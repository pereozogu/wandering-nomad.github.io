					85% of what happened at the (crossed out <i>Roxbury’s</i>) Mason
					Lodge on the 8th of December, 2022.
				</h2>
				<p>
					Play-by-play action and festivities.<br />

					[draft mode] A night at the Mason’s…, or shall we say “into the
					woods”. A revealing first outing into the awards ceremony to honor
					the best companies to work for in 2022.<br />

					The event was to honor the top workplaces rankings for 2022 by the
					Baltimore Sun. And, for us, Bellese Technologies, this is our
					fifth consecutive award.<br />

					Woah!<br />

					The journey to the premises was long and winding as my GPS guided
					me through the Worthington, littered with unlit single-lane roads,
					sharp blinding curves, steep valleys, and a 1-car bridge that
					would frighten the uninitiated driver. “Worthington woods” is a
					region between Owings Mills and Hunt Valley, MD. That was the
					option given rather than the highway route before arriving at a
					well-hidden hilltop estate surrounded by giant corporate
					buildings.<br />

					To add to the mystery, the steady stream of guests, patrons,
					awardees and other clientele wreathed from the international
					circle road, through the guard checkpoint and up to the building
					like a sea of Christmas lights twinkling against the dark, unlit
					estate grounds. All were flagged to stop and were asked the same
					question: “what are you here for?” And the common responses were:
					“the party,” “the award ceremony,” or, affectionately, “I am with
					them.” The Guard gestured at the vehicle you were in with an “up
					the hill and to your left” response.<br />

					The building was as impressive to behold as it was old and
					majestic. An excellent venue for gatherings and soirees.<br />

					My only exposure to the “Free Masons” were from fictional
					representations from TV and movies like National Treasure with
					Nicolas Cage, Wanted with Angelina Jolie, and more -
					<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_about_secret_societies"
					>Films about secret societies</a
					>, so I was going with the flow and accepted whatever I
					encountered.<br />

					The entryway that grants you passage into the building is shielded
					by double Oak, solid glass and Wrought iron-gilded doors. Once
					past the first set of doors, you could almost miss the massive
					emblem of the Freemasons in brilliant, multi-colored tiles at your
					feet if you proceed too quickly to the second set of doors.<br />

					Once inside the building, prepare yourself to be treated to grand
					splendor in the foyer by a dazzling array of beautifully tiled
					floors, walls, decor and massive chandeliers all over the place.
					“It is bigger on the inside” —
					<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_on_the_inside_(disambiguation)"
					>TARDIS.</a
					><br />

					There is a staircase, best viewed as fit for pageantry, which
					folks couldn’t stop talking about, in addition to the chandeliers
					and art displayed in the halls.<br />

					After taking in the first sets of views in a packed and fairly
					loud hallway, I was asked to find my name tag and proceeded to
					find our table. Vertically, my name tag, with a gold emblem of the
					best workplaces 2022 on the top left, read Pere Ozogu, Bellese
					Technologies, table 30. After waiting for a few minutes, I turned
					around to face the entryway so that I could scan for familiar
					faces when I noticed Brendan (with a dirty martini in tow) and
					Evan (attaching his name tag to his shirt). We exchanged
					pleasantries, and all asked if we were here first to arrive or if
					others were here already…, and while the sentence still lingered
					in the air, Karen and Curtis walked in from around the corner with
					drinks (in hand) to meet and greet us.<br />

					The ladies were dressed to the nines while the gentlemen were in
					predominantly sports coats; however, there were less than 15 folks
					with full-length suits and ties. The service, drinks and food
					choices were impeccable: from Crab dip and Pita chips to Shrimp
					tacos, from barbecue skewers to Sage Ravioli and Butternut Squash,
					from your standard bud light, wines and blonde Guinness to
					bourbons and whiskeys I have never seen before; the wafted aromas,
					as folks walked passed you to their inter destination: be it the
					selfie booth, their respective standing tables or lingering around
					the food tables, spoke volumes of how expensive those amber
					libations cost. At the same time, the catering staff milled
					alongside the guests as deftly as efficient worker bees…; that
					way, by the time your plate was empty or your flute was drained of
					its contents, a gloved hand with a stainless steel tray
					materialized at your side.<br />

					We discussed our travel plans, inquired over other projects, and
					reminisced about the office and tech toys. Curious-er and
					curious-er. Veterans in the company already have clever toys,
					gadgets, and utilities to snap up, but newbies still go for the
					traditional monitor. So, we advised them to slack out a question,
					and the community would chime in to help.<br />

					After a short while, 90 mins or so, we were ushered into the main
					hall that looked to seat 500-600 folks (all numbered tables and
					ten chairs per table), and ours was number 30 and right by the
					door. We took pictures at the designated photo station, conversed
					more about the lack of bottled water (for the second time) and
					returned to the discussion over what we received (or were denied;
					wait! what!) as a tech toy this year. Scandalous, I tell you.
					Uncontrollable laughter ensued, and suggestions were offered for
					further consideration and resubmission to the “powers that be” for
					re-evaluation and approval.<br />

					The announcer, and spokesperson for the Baltimore Sun, called our
					attention as the main event was about to begin; to honor the best
					companies to work for. The award ceremony was divided into several
					categories: Small (that included us), Medium and, Large companies.
					And in addition, extra awards were handed out to the top 3
					companies in every category.<br />

					We were all waiting to hear when our name, Bellese Technologies
					LLC, would be called to let the hall know how large we were. No!
					We were not to be outdone by schools, large corporations or
					charity groups who outnumbered us 3, 4, or even 5 to 1. As each
					company’s name was read out, the rhythmic cheers and shouts in the
					hall were accounted for. Still, we were not dismayed a bit: at the
					table, we had pseudo-rehearsed our response for when Bellese’s
					name would be called. On cue, like a well-rehearsed crew, we let
					out a roar and a cacophony of hand-clappers to the astonishment
					and gazed looks from around the room. Next, a lady tapped Ricardo
					on the shoulder and asked, “who would accept the award?” to which
					we all looked at Curtis. She handed us our coveted plaque, and
					Curtis posed with it for more pictures. About 10 minutes later, we
					all made a beeline for the exit with a gift bag.<br />

					We came, saw (and ate, of course), roared, and left.<br />

					Overall, it was an excellent opportunity to hang out with the
					company and to visit this location.

					Test jested, failed timeout exceeded in react?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Happy Friday everyone,<br />
					Here's another fix I found for an issue that I had to fix in our react app.<br />
					<b>Error during automated testing:</b>
					<blockquote>[thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms for a test.
					Use jest.setTimeout(newTimeout) to increase the timeout value, if this is a long-running test."]</blockquote><br />
					Fix - <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/11607">Jest issue 11607</a><br />

					VS Code Snafu & not opening files to a new tab
				</h2>
				<p>
					Hello everyone.<br />
					Long time since my last post.<br />
					After a day and a half of pouring through SOF for solutions to fix the problem of my files no longer opening up in a new tab, I decided to un-install VSC from my Mac (big sur).<br />
					Here's the SOF like I used but didn't work for me: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38713405/open-files-always-in-a-new-tab/46498078 <br />
					As it turns out, when you update VSC, it doesn't remove/un-install the older versions. In my case, I found 7 versions spread out in the system and deleted them all.<br />
					Next, I installed 1.58.2 and it worked like a charm.<br />
					Hope it helps....<br />
					Happy coding.<br />
					Cheers,<br />
					P.
