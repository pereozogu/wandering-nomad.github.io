								<p>Play-by-play action and festivities.<br />
									[draft mode]<br />
									A night at the Mason's…, or shall we say “into the
									woods”. A revealing first outing into the awards ceremony to honor
									the best companies to work for in 2022.<br />
									The event was to honor the top workplaces rankings for 2022 by the
									Baltimore Sun. And, for us, Bellese Technologies, this is our
									fifth consecutive award.<br />			
									Woah!
								</p>
								<p>The journey to the premises was long and winding as my GPS guided
									me through the Worthington, littered with unlit single-lane roads,
									sharp blinding curves, steep valleys, and a 1-car bridge that
									would frighten the uninitiated driver. “Worthington woods” is a
									region between Owings Mills and Hunt Valley, MD. That was the
									option given rather than the highway route before arriving at a
									well-hidden hilltop estate surrounded by giant corporate
									buildings.</p>
								<p>To add to the mystery, the steady stream of guests, patrons,
									awardees and other clientele wreathed from the international
									circle road, through the guard checkpoint and up to the building
									like a sea of Christmas lights twinkling against the dark, unlit
									estate grounds. All were flagged to stop and were asked the same
									question: “what are you here for?” And the common responses were:
									“the party,” “the award ceremony,” or, affectionately, “I am with
									them.” The Guard gestured at the vehicle you were in with an “up
									the hill and to your left” response.</p>
								<p>The building was as impressive to behold as it was old and
									majestic. An excellent venue for gatherings and soirees.<br />
				
									My only exposure to the “Free Masons” were from fictional
									representations from TV and movies like National Treasure with
									Nicolas Cage, Wanted with Angelina Jolie, and more -
									<a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_about_secret_societies"
									>Films about secret societies</a
									>, so I was going with the flow and accepted whatever I
									encountered.</p>
								<p>The entryway that grants you passage into the building is shielded
									by double Oak, solid glass and Wrought iron-gilded doors. Once
									past the first set of doors, you could almost miss the massive
									emblem of the Freemasons in brilliant, multi-colored tiles at your
									feet if you proceed too quickly to the second set of doors.<br />
				
									Once inside the building, prepare yourself to be treated to grand
									splendor in the foyer by a dazzling array of beautifully tiled
									floors, walls, decor and massive chandeliers all over the place.
									“It is bigger on the inside” —
									<a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_on_the_inside_(disambiguation)"
									>TARDIS.</a
									><br />
				
									There is a staircase, best viewed as fit for pageantry, which
									folks couldn't stop talking about, in addition to the chandeliers
									and art displayed in the halls.</p>
								<p>After taking in the first sets of views in a packed and fairly
									loud hallway, I was asked to find my name tag and proceeded to
									find our table. Vertically, my name tag, with a gold emblem of the
									best workplaces 2022 on the top left, read Pere Ozogu, Bellese
									Technologies, table 30. After waiting for a few minutes, I turned
									around to face the entryway so that I could scan for familiar
									faces when I noticed Brendan (with a dirty martini in tow) and
									Evan (attaching his name tag to his shirt). We exchanged
									pleasantries, and all asked if we were here first to arrive or if
									others were here already…, and while the sentence still lingered
									in the air, Karen and Curtis walked in from around the corner with
									drinks (in hand) to meet and greet us.</p>
								<p>The ladies were dressed to the nines while the gentlemen were in
									predominantly sports coats; however, there were less than 15 folks
									with full-length suits and ties. The service, drinks and food
									choices were impeccable: from Crab dip and Pita chips to Shrimp
									tacos, from barbecue skewers to Sage Ravioli and Butternut Squash,
									from your standard bud light, wines and blonde Guinness to
									bourbons and whiskeys I have never seen before; the wafted aromas,
									as folks walked passed you to their inter destination: be it the
									selfie booth, their respective standing tables or lingering around
									the food tables, spoke volumes of how expensive those amber
									libations cost. At the same time, the catering staff milled
									alongside the guests as deftly as efficient worker bees…; that
									way, by the time your plate was empty or your flute was drained of
									its contents, a gloved hand with a stainless steel tray
									materialized at your side.</p>
								<p>We discussed our travel plans, inquired over other projects, and
									reminisced about the office and tech toys. Curious-er and
									curious-er. Veterans in the company already have clever toys,
									gadgets, and utilities to snap up, but newbies still go for the
									traditional monitor. So, we advised them to slack out a question,
									and the community would chime in to help.</p>
								<p>After a short while, 90 mins or so, we were ushered into the main
									hall that looked to seat 500-600 folks (all numbered tables and
									ten chairs per table), and ours was number 30 and right by the
									door. We took pictures at the designated photo station, conversed
									more about the lack of bottled water (for the second time) and
									returned to the discussion over what we received (or were denied;
									wait! what!) as a tech toy this year. Scandalous, I tell you.
									Uncontrollable laughter ensued, and suggestions were offered for
									further consideration and resubmission to the “powers that be” for
									re-evaluation and approval.</p>
								<p>The announcer, and spokesperson for the Baltimore Sun, called our
									attention as the main event was about to begin; to honor the best
									companies to work for. The award ceremony was divided into several
									categories: Small (that included us), Medium and, Large companies.
									And in addition, extra awards were handed out to the top 3
									companies in every category.</p>
								<p>We were all waiting to hear when our name, Bellese Technologies
									LLC, would be called to let the hall know how large we were. No!
									We were not to be outdone by schools, large corporations or
									charity groups who outnumbered us 3, 4, or even 5 to 1. As each
									company's name was read out, the rhythmic cheers and shouts in the
									hall were accounted for. Still, we were not dismayed a bit: at the
									table, we had pseudo-rehearsed our response for when Bellese's
									name would be called. On cue, like a well-rehearsed crew, we let
									out a roar and a cacophony of hand-clappers to the astonishment
									and gazed looks from around the room. Next, a lady tapped Ricardo
									on the shoulder and asked, “who would accept the award?” to which
									we all looked at Curtis. She handed us our coveted plaque, and
									Curtis posed with it for more pictures. About 10 minutes later, we
									all made a beeline for the exit with a gift bag.</p>
								<p>We came, saw <i>(and ate, of course)</i>, roared, and left.</p>
								<p>Overall, it was an excellent opportunity to hang out with the
									company and to visit this location.</p>
